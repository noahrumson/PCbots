#### In order to connect to the Raspberry Pi, follow these steps: 
  - Plug the Pi into a power source (USB has worked so far)
  - Connect to the "defaultdrone" network (wait 60 seconds or so until the Pi has booted)
  - The password is "bigbubba" 
  - Open a terminal prompt and type the following command: 
    
```sh
$ ssh pi@defaultdrone.local
```
    
  - Type in the password "bigbubba"
  - You are now connected to the Pi!
